# Contributing Guidelines

Pull request are more than welcome on the
[GitHub page](https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator).

## Development environment

This project uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce style-checks.
These checks are enforced in the GitHub Actions, but it is encouraged to install
a development environment locally as well.

```console
$ pip install -e .[dev]
$ pre-commit install
```
